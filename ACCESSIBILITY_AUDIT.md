- [x] Important information is emphasized appropriately
- [x] Content flows naturally when read aloud

## Testing Methods Used

1. **Automated Testing**
   - Lighthouse accessibility audit
   - axe-core accessibility testing
   - WAVE web accessibility evaluator

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Keyboard-only navigation
   - Screen reader testing (NVDA/JAWS)
   - Color contrast verification
   - Mobile device testing

3. **User Testing**
   - Testing with users who rely on assistive technologies
   - Feedback on humanized content clarity
   - Usability testing across different devices
