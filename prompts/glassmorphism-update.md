# WeatherWise Dashboard: Glassmorphism UI Update Document

## Introduction

This document details the update of the **WeatherWise Dashboard** to adopt a cohesive **glassmorphism (glass look) UI** using SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS. The goal is to apply a frosted-glass effect across all cards, panels, and interactive elements, ensuring a modern, visually appealing, and consistent user experience. Each task must be committed with meaningful commit messages and thoroughly tested before proceeding. The document includes a feature list, PRD, task list with prompts, a progress checklist, and references. Load this document into Cursor's agent prompt to systematically implement the glassmorphism style across the app.

## Feature List (Glassmorphism Update)

1. **Glassmorphic Card Components**
   - All dashboard cards (weather, suggestions, alerts) use a glassmorphism style: semi-transparent backgrounds, blur, and subtle borders.
2. **Glassmorphic Panels and Modals**
   - Any modal, sidebar, or panel adopts the glass look for consistency.
3. **Glassmorphic Buttons and Inputs**
   - Buttons, toggles, and input fields styled with glassmorphism: transparency, blur, and soft shadows.
4. **Weather-Reactive Background System**
   - Dynamic background colors and gradients that change based on current weather conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy, snowy, etc.).
5. **Humanized Suggestion Content**
   - All suggestion categories display 1-2 natural, conversational sentences instead of bullet points or short phrases.
6. **Clean, Minimalist Design**
   - Simplified layouts with better spacing, typography hierarchy, and reduced visual clutter.
7. **Dark/Light Mode Support**
   - Glassmorphism adapts to both light and dark modes, maintaining readability and style.
8. **Responsive and Accessible**
   - All glassmorphic elements remain fully responsive and accessible.

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Introduction
- **Project Name**: WeatherWise Dashboard (Glassmorphism UI Update)
- **Purpose**: Refresh the dashboard with a modern glassmorphism style, improving visual appeal and user experience.

### Objectives
- Apply glassmorphism (frosted-glass) style to all UI components.
- Ensure style consistency across weather cards, suggestion cards, alerts, modals, buttons, and inputs.
- Maintain accessibility and responsiveness.
- Implement proper Git workflow with meaningful commits and testing.

### Features
1. **Glassmorphic Cards**
   - Weather, suggestion, and alert cards use semi-transparent backgrounds (`bg-white/20`, `bg-slate-800/30`), `backdrop-blur`, and subtle borders (`border border-white/30`).
2. **Panels & Modals**
   - Any overlay or modal uses glassmorphism with appropriate blur and shadow.
3. **Buttons & Inputs**
   - Transparent backgrounds, blur, and soft borders/shadows for all interactive elements.
4. **Weather-Reactive Backgrounds**
   - Dynamic background gradients that change based on weather conditions (sunny: warm oranges/yellows, rainy: cool blues/grays, snowy: whites/light blues, cloudy: soft grays).
5. **Humanized Suggestions**
   - Replace technical bullet points with natural, conversational 1-2 sentence recommendations for each category.
6. **Clean Design System**
   - Consistent spacing, improved typography hierarchy, reduced visual noise, and better component organization.
7. **Dark/Light Mode**
   - Glassmorphism adapts to both modes, ensuring contrast and readability.
8. **Accessibility**
   - Sufficient contrast, focus states, and keyboard navigation.

### Technical Requirements
- **Frontend**: Svelte (SvelteKit), Tailwind CSS (with custom glassmorphism utilities if needed).
- **Tools**: Cursor (agent mode), Vite for setup.

## Additional Notes

- **Current Style System Analysis**:
  - Existing styles in `app.css` use traditional card designs with solid backgrounds and basic shadows.
  - Current suggestion components use short, technical phrases instead of natural language.
  - No dynamic background system exists - static backgrounds only.
  - Components have inconsistent spacing and typography hierarchy.

- **Glassmorphism Best Practices**:
  - Use Tailwind's `backdrop-blur-lg`, `bg-white/10-30`, `border border-white/20`, and `shadow-xl` utilities.
  - Ensure text contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text).
  - Test glass effects on various background colors and weather-reactive backgrounds.

- **Weather-Reactive Background Mapping**:
  - **Sunny/Clear**: Warm gradients (orange, yellow, light blue)
  - **Rainy**: Cool blues and grays with subtle animation
  - **Cloudy**: Soft grays and muted tones
  - **Snowy**: Cool whites, light blues, and silver tones
  - **Stormy**: Darker blues and purples with dynamic effects
  - **Foggy**: Muted grays with increased blur effects

- **Humanized Suggestion Examples**:
  - **Before**: "T-shirt - Hot weather"
  - **After**: "It's beautifully sunny today! You'll be most comfortable in light, breathable clothing like a t-shirt and shorts."
  - **Before**: "Umbrella - Rain protection"
  - **After**: "Looks like rain is expected today. Don't forget to grab an umbrella and maybe a light raincoat to stay dry and comfortable."

- **Performance**: Monitor that backdrop-blur doesn't impact performance on lower-end devices.
- **Fallbacks**: Consider fallback styles for browsers that don't support backdrop-filter.
- **Custom Utilities**: Extend Tailwind config with weather-specific background utilities and clean design tokens.
