WeatherSync Decision Hub (MVP)

### 1.2 Purpose
The WeatherSync Decision Hub is a focused Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the ultimate weather dashboard, designed to empower users to make informed, weather-driven decisions about **wardrobe** (primary focus), **fitness and exercise**, **meals**, and **activities**. It integrates five key features from the Decision-Making Support cluster: **Transition Forecast**, **Smart Weather Wardrobe Advisor**, **Weather-Optimized Fitness Advisor** (new), **Weather-Adaptive Meal Planner**, and **Weather-Tethered Adventure Curator**. Powered by the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) for weather data and YAML weather state transitions for predictive insights, the Hub provides clear, actionable recommendations to reduce decision fatigue and enhance daily planning. The **Smart Weather Wardrobe Advisor** prioritizes outfit choices (e.g., “Wear a raincoat for Showery weather”), while the **Weather-Optimized Fitness Advisor** offers tailored exercise proposals (e.g., “Indoor yoga for Showery conditions”), complemented by meal (e.g., “Lentil soup for Rainy weather”) and activity recommendations (e.g., “Join a Sunny farmers’ market”). The MVP incorporates **contextual advertising** and **e-commerce integration** to offer weather-relevant products (e.g., clothing, fitness gear, groceries, event tickets), ensuring a seamless, monetized experience that feels non-intrusive and value-adding. The Hub delivers an immersive, intuitive user experience through a weather-themed interface with a **Decision Timeline**, **Weather Map**, and **Decision Journal**, enhanced by **Mermaid diagrams** for clear documentation.
