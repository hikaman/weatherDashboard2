# Weather Dashboard Codebase: High-Level Summary

## Project Structure

- **src/components/**: Contains Svelte components for UI, logic, and visualization. Includes core dashboard elements, weather displays, search, toggles, modals, and tests for key components.
- **src/routes/**: Implements SvelteKit's file-based routing. Contains layouts and main page entry points.
- **src/lib/**: Houses utilities, API integrations (e.g., weather, i18n), state mappers, and a large city list for location-based features.
- **src/stores/**: Manages application state (weather, air quality, alerts, filters) using Svelte stores and TypeScript.
- **src/utils/**: Utility functions, e.g., for weather themes.
- **memory-bank/**: Documents project decisions, technical/product context, progress, and system patterns.
- **.cursor/rules/**: Contains core rules, tailored project guidelines, and a SvelteKit development guide to ensure best practices.
- **docs/**: Documentation folder (this summary is here).

## Key Patterns & Conventions

- **SvelteKit & Svelte5**: Uses SSR/SSG, file-based routing, and Svelte runes for state, effects, and props.
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, interfaces over types, no enums, functional/declarative style.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling; Shadcn components for UI consistency.
- **State Management**: Svelte stores for reactive state; classes for complex state machines.
- **i18n**: Paraglide.js for internationalization, supporting multiple languages and accessibility.
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and focus management.
- **Performance**: Code splitting, SSR/SSG, minimal client JS, and lazy loading for assets.
- **Testing**: Unit tests for key components and stores.

## Notable Features

- Modular, reusable Svelte components for weather data, search, alerts, and user interaction.
- Comprehensive state management for weather, air quality, and user preferences.
- Integration with weather APIs and large city datasets.
- Internationalization and accessibility as first-class concerns.
- Extensive documentation and decision logs in the memory bank.
- Adherence to custom and SvelteKit best practices via .cursor/rules.
- Animated SVG weather icons are mapped by weather type group (not yet per individual WMO code).

## Recommendations & Observations

- **Strengths**: Clean modular structure, strong adherence to SvelteKit/Svelte5 and project-specific conventions, robust state management, and focus on accessibility and i18n.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Continue to expand test coverage, monitor performance for large data (e.g., city list), and keep dependencies up to date.
