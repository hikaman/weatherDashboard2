# Human-in-the-Loop Mobile App Initiative Work Plan

## 1. Context & Assumptions

- **Project:** WeatherWise Dashboard (WeatherSync Decision Hub MVP)
- **Goal:** Deliver native Android and iOS apps, using a human-in-the-loop, prompt-driven workflow for ideation, requirements, and task management.
- **Principles:**  
  - Human-AI collaboration at every requirements and planning stage  
  - Maximum code sharing (cross-platform stack)  
  - All deliverables and code ready for App Store and Play Store submission  
  - Accessibility, internationalization, and compliance as first-class citizens
- **Current State:**  
  - Web app (SvelteKit) is feature-complete for MVP.
  - Memory Bank and .cursor/rules are up to date.
  - Most features are implemented and documented for web.
- **Assumptions:**  
  - React Native + Expo will be used for mobile (can be changed if you specify otherwise).
  - All business logic, stores, and as much UI as possible will be shared between web and mobile.
  - Prompt-driven workflow will be markdown-based, with human review/edit at each stage.
  - All code, assets, and documentation will be prepared for store submission.

## 2. Work Plan Phases & Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation & Stack Setup

**1.1. Framework Confirmation**  
- Evaluate Svelte Native, React Native, Flutter, Expo.
- Confirm React Native + Expo for maximum code sharing and store readiness.
- Document decision in `/memory-bank/decision-log.md`.

**1.2. Monorepo Structure**  
- Set up monorepo with:
  - `/shared/` (business logic, stores, utilities, shared UI)
  - `/mobile/` (React Native/Expo app)
  - `/web/` (existing SvelteKit app)
  - `/prompts/` (prompt-driven workflow markdowns)
  - `/docs/`, `/memory-bank/` (context, architecture, compliance, progress)
- Add linting, formatting, and commit hooks.

**1.3. CI/CD Pipeline**  
- Set up automated builds for Android (APK/AAB) and iOS (IPA).
- Integrate linting, tests, and artifact generation.
- Add scripts for store asset generation and submission readiness.

---

### Phase 2: Prompt-Driven Human-in-the-Loop Workflow

**2.1. Prompt Workflow Implementation**  
- Create markdown templates for:
  - Feature ideas (`feature-ideas.md`)
  - Feature lists (`feature-list.md`)
  - PRDs (`prd.md`)
  - Task lists (`tasklist.md`)
- Add process documentation in `/prompts/README.md`.

**2.2. Workflow Automation**  
- Scripts to parse, validate, and process prompt files.
- Optionally, simple UI for prompt submission and review.

**2.3. Pilot the Workflow**  
- Run through the full prompt cycle with a sample feature (e.g., "Add weather-based push notifications").
- Validate and refine the workflow.

---

### Phase 3: Core App Implementation

**3.1. Port Existing Features to Mobile**  
- Weather data fetching and caching (shared logic).
- Unified suggestions (wardrobe, food, activity, exercise).
- Responsive, accessible UI (shared components, platform-specific tweaks).
- E-commerce and ad integration (shared logic, platform-specific UI as needed).

**3.2. Platform-Specific Enhancements**  
- Native navigation, gestures, notifications.
- Permissions (location, notifications).
- Offline support and local storage.

**3.3. Accessibility & Internationalization**  
- ARIA, screen reader, and keyboard navigation.
- Multi-language support and RTL layouts.

**3.4. Testing**  
- Unit, integration, and E2E tests (shared and platform-specific).
- Manual test checklists for store compliance.

---

### Phase 4: Store Readiness & Submission

**4.1. Store Asset Preparation**  
- App icons, splash screens, branding assets.
- Screenshots, videos, and descriptions for store listings.

**4.2. Compliance & Legal**  
- Privacy policy, terms, and data handling documentation.
- Accessibility and privacy audits.

**4.3. Store Submission**  
- Prepare and upload builds to App Store and Play Store.
- Address review feedback and resubmit as needed.

**4.4. Release & Post-Launch**  
- Monitor analytics and crash reports.
- Plan for updates and user feedback integration.

## 4. Dependencies & Constraints

- **Dependencies:**  
  - Framework selection impacts all downstream tasks  
  - Store asset preparation depends on finalized UI  
  - E-commerce integration may require legal/compliance review

- **Constraints:**  
  - Must maximize code sharing  
  - Must meet App Store and Play Store requirements  
  - Accessibility and internationalization are non-negotiable  
  - All code and assets must be open for review and ready for submission

---

## 5. Documentation & Memory Bank Updates

- All decisions, context, and progress must be logged in `/memory-bank/`.
- Update `/docs/architecture.md` and `/docs/codebase-summary.md` with new mobile architecture and workflow.
- Update `.cursor/rules` with new patterns and process rules as they emerge.

---

## 6. Review & Execution

- This work plan is ready for AI or human execution.
- All context, dependencies, and constraints are included for autonomous or collaborative progress.
- To execute, follow the phases and tasks in order, updating documentation and memory bank at each step.
